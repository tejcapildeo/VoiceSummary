# Voice Summary

This app helps with meeting summaries by either recording on the spot or accepting an audio file. Then it summarizes and gives the key insights and actionables. Very useful for compiling information, referring to discussions in the past, or sharing the main ideas with someone
who missed the meeting.
This is a first step. I'd like to expand this into something bigger, tailoring it specifically to a use case (for example doctor and patient consultations, and then a medical report is generated).

You can find the app over here:
